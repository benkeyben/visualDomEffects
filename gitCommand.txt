1. You can view all of your settings and where they are 
   coming from 
   git config --list --show-origin

2. The first thing is to set your username and email address. You need to do this only once if you pass the --global option, because then Git will always use that inforamtion for anything you do on that system. If you want to override this with a different name or email address for specific projects, you can run the command without the --global option when your'r in that project.
   git config --global user.name "John Doe"
   git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com

3. To set main as the default branch name do
   git config --global init.defaultBranch main

4. If you want to check your configuration settings, you 
   can use the
   git config --list

5. Setting upp a .gitignore file for your new repositor before you get going is generally a good idea so you don't accidentally commit files that you really don't  want in your Git repository.

6. As an example, if you commit and then realize you forgot to stage the changes in a file you wanted
to add to this commit, you can do something like this:
=> git commit -m 'Initial commit'
=> git add forgotten_file
=> git commit --amend

HOW TO ADD A FILE TO .gitignore
=> echo mylogfile.log >> .gitignore
=> git rm -r -f --cached mylogfile
=> git add .
=> git commit -m "Removed mylogfile"

TO REMOVE A FILE BEFORE push
=> git rm --cached index.js

REMOVING A FILE ADDED IN THE MOST RECENT UNPUSHED commit
If the file waws added with your most recent commit and you have not pushed to github, you can delete the file and amend commit
=> git rm --cached index.js
=> git commit --amend -HEAD 

To add a new remote Git repository as a shortname you can reference easily, run 
=> git remote add <shortname> <url>
=> git remote add bkb https://github.com/benkeyben/bankistApp.git

If you want to see more information about a particular remote, you can use the
=> git remote show <remote>
=> git remote show origin
=> git remote show bkbBankist

TAGGING
1. To list existing tags
   => git tag

2. If you're interested only in looking at the 1.8.5 series
   you can run 
   => git tag -l "v1.8.5*"

3. Creating annotated tags
   => git tag -a v1.00 -m "my version 1.00"

4. You can see the tag data along with the commit that
   was tagged by using the git show command
   => git show v1.00
